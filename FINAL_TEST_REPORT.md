- ✅ Fixed performance monitoring import path
- ✅ Resolved circular dependencies

### 3. Modal Service Implementation
- ✅ Replaced ALL native browser dialogs (alert, confirm, prompt)
- ✅ Created comprehensive modal service with dark mode support
- ✅ Updated 30+ files to use new modal service
- ✅ Added keyboard shortcuts (Escape, Enter)

### 4. Component Fixes

## 📊 Current Status

### Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Firebase Connection Warnings** (Expected in test environment)
   - Location: `/login` and `/settings/profile`
   - Error: `Could not reach Cloud Firestore backend`
   - **Reason**: Test environment doesn't have Firebase credentials
   - **Impact**: None - this is expected behavior
   - **Solution**: Add Firebase emulator or test credentials if needed
