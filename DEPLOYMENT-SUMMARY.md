## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Large Bundle Size**: The application has 6616+ modules which causes slow build times
2. **Upload Timeouts**: Some large files may timeout during deployment
3. **Test Failures**: Several test suites are failing due to missing mocks
4. **Function Deployment**: Cloud Functions need to be deployed separately

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Deploy Cloud Functions**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   yarn build
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Verify Production Deployment**
   - Test critical user flows
   - Check authentication
   - Verify data persistence
   - Test offline functionality

3. **Setup Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Configure DNS records
   - Add custom domain in Firebase Console
   - Update SSL certificates

4. **Enable Monitoring**
   - Setup Firebase Performance Monitoring
   - Configure Error Reporting
   - Enable Analytics

5. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Configure GitHub Actions
   - Automate testing and deployment
   - Set up staging environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Commands

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Build and deploy everything
yarn build && firebase deploy

# Deploy only hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Deploy with specific project
firebase deploy --only hosting --project labsystem-a1
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check deployment status
firebase hosting:sites:list

# View deployment history
firebase hosting:versions:list

# Rollback to previous version
firebase hosting:rollback
```
