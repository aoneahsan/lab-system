- Lines of Code: ~2,500+
- Test Coverage: 0% (testing not yet implemented)
- Bundle Size: TBD

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Implement biometric authentication
2. Start building the Patient Management module
3. Set up testing infrastructure
4. Configure Capacitor for mobile deployment

### 📝 Notes
- All custom packages from Ahsan have been installed
- HIPAA compliance requirements need to be addressed in each module
- Offline support needs to be implemented across all features
- Multi-tenant data isolation is enforced through Firebase security rules
