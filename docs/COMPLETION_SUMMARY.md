- Fixed import paths to use dashboard components
- Maintained lazy loading for performance

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (responsive design)
- **State**: Zustand stores for each module
- **Mobile**: Capacitor-ready components
- **Backend**: Firebase structure defined (multi-tenant)

### Key Features Implemented
- **Business Logic**: Westgard rules, validation rules, chain of custody
- **UI/UX**: Consistent design patterns, responsive layouts
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
- **Services**: Firebase-ready service layer
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, optimized imports

### Code Quality
- TypeScript throughout (minimal `any` types)
- Modular component structure
- Reusable components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Documentation added

## API Timeout Strategy

Successfully addressed API timeout issues by:
- Creating smaller, focused files
- Breaking large components into manageable pieces
- Sequential file creation instead of batch operations
